## Build a Clock Using Vanilla JS
---
### Overview: 

This is a project in which we practiced JS by building a digital clock to run in various timezones. 

---
### What Was Learned: 

* Writing HTML5 semantically correct
* Using and importing Googlefonts into CSS rather than HTML 
* Using if-statements to set the time to include a zero if it was a single number
* Using setInterval function to keep the clock refreshing to retrieve the time
* Using pattern.flaticon.com to create patterns for background images
